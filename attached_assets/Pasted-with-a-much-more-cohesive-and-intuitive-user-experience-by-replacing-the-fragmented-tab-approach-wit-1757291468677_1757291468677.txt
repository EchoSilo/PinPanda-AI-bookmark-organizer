with a much more cohesive and intuitive user experience by replacing the fragmented tab approach with an integrated bookmark manager.

üéØ New Integrated Flow Design

What Changed:
Removed separate tabs for Browse, Search, AI Chat, and Export
Created a unified interface where everything works together seamlessly
Made bookmark browsing the primary experience with other features as natural extensions

üèóÔ∏è New Architecture:

Sidebar Navigation: Category tree for organized browsing (primary interaction)
Integrated Search Bar: Always available at the top, searches across all bookmarks
AI Assistant: Right-side panel (Sheet) accessible from anywhere
Export Dialog: Modal accessible from the header actions
Smart Context: The interface adapts based on what you're doing (browsing vs searching)

üåü Key Improvements:

Cohesive Browsing Experience
Category sidebar remains persistent for navigation
Main content area shows bookmarks based on selection or search
Dynamic header shows context (category name, search results, etc.)

Contextual Search Integration
Search works globally across all bookmarks, not in isolation
AI search toggle enhances results with semantic understanding  
Filter controls appear contextually when searching
Clear visual feedback showing results count and active filters

Accessible AI Assistant
Side panel design keeps the assistant available without disrupting workflow
Conversational interface with bookmark recommendations shown inline
Direct actions from AI responses (open bookmarks, etc.)

Streamlined Actions
Export and settings in clean modal dialogs
New upload always accessible in header
Quick actions on individual bookmarks (open, favorite, etc.)

üé® Visual Flow Benefits:
Single mental model: Users stay in one interface instead of jumping between tabs
Natural workflow: Browse ‚Üí Search ‚Üí Ask AI ‚Üí Export feels seamless  
Reduced cognitive load: No need to remember which tab has which feature
Better discoverability: All features visible and accessible at once

The new design feels like a proper bookmark management application rather than a collection of separate tools. Users can now fluidly move between browsing categories, searching for specific bookmarks, getting AI assistance, and exporting their collection without losing context or breaking their workflow.
